## `compression/huffman_table_generator` Module: Huffman Encoding Table Generator

This module provides a C++ implementation for generating Huffman coding tables, a crucial step in data compression. It focuses on the creation of canonical Huffman codes based on symbol frequencies.

### Functionality

The `table_generator.cpp` file contains the core logic for:

*   Frequency Analysis: It includes a `frequency` template structure that efficiently counts symbol occurrences within data, forming the basis for Huffman tree construction [citation: 0].
*   Huffman Tree Construction: The `huffman` class implements the algorithm for building the Huffman tree [citation: 0]. This involves:
    *   Node Structure: Utilizes a nested `node` structure to represent the tree's internal and leaf nodes, storing elements, counts, and parent/child pointers [citation: 0].
    *   Element Structure: Defines an `elem` structure to hold the symbol, its length (number of bits in the Huffman code), and the generated code [citation: 0].
    *   Priority Queue: Employs a `std::priority_queue` to iteratively combine nodes based on their frequencies, ultimately forming the Huffman tree [citation: 0].
*   Huffman Table Creation: A static `create_table` function recursively traverses the constructed Huffman tree to assign lengths to each symbol, populating the internal table [citation: 0].
*   Encoding Table Generation: After the tree is built and lengths are assigned, the module generates the actual binary Huffman codes for each symbol, ensuring they are canonical (codes of the same length are grouped together and assigned sequentially) [citation: 0].

Role in Compression

This module is a fundamental component for any Huffman-based compression system. It takes raw frequency data and outputs the necessary encoding table, which can then be used by other parts of a compression program (e.g., the `hufstr.h` functions mentioned in the includes) to perform the actual data encoding and decoding.## `compression/huffman_table_generator` Module: Huffman Encoding Table Generator
